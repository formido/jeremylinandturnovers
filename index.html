<p><i>March 4, 2012</i> - Contrary to recent hype, Jeremy Lin does not have a turnover problem. A concise way to demonstrate this is to make a graph with each game's turnovers for the 13 games before Lin started playing major minutes and the 13 games since.</p>

<p>It looks like the Knick's totoal team turnovers have stayed pretty much the same, doesn't it? In fact, the team has turned the ball over somewhat fewer times since Jeremy Lin took over.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
  <th>13 games before Lin</th>
  <th>13 games with Lin</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>220 rebounds</td>
  <td>207 rebounds</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We can also average out the number of turnovers for the entire season pre- and post-Lin.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
  <th>Before Lin</th>
  <th>With Lin</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>15.91 r/g</td>
  <td>15.92 r/g</td>
<tr>
</table>

<p>Can't just say "he has a turnover problem".</p>

<p>http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7641147/boston-celtics-legend-bob-cousy-loves-new-york-knicks-jeremy-lin</p>

<p>Cousy doesn't believe Lin will have to fall out of a tree to develop a stronger left hand, one of his few game-day needs. "It's a simple adjustment," Cousy said. "I used to go through periods where guys were picking off my path to the right, and I had to keep them honest. You don't have to go five times to the left and five to the right -- two and eight is fine, and Lin will be able to develop that part of his game."</p>

<p>People like to point to sonic guard as bein like jerem lin. I wonder if there's anyone like jeremy lin in terms of production and TOs that we can look to in the past. Oh, right, Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>He initiates a ton of offense. What if he had 10 TOs but they were all the Knicks TOs every game? Would that be a problem? Several other analysts have made this same point.</p>

<p>Now, it's possible that Lin accounts for a lot of the team's turnovers, but is more turnover prone than his teammates also. In fact, even with his high usage, he has a high turnover rate for a guard. But, keep in mind that him making a play is still preferable to most of his teammates making a play due to non-PG even higher TO rates. And second, if you've watched him play, you see that he reduces the likelihood of teammates turning it over by putting them into position to make an immedite score easy move. Less one on one play by non-PGs equals fewer TOs. There's especially no excuse among Knick fans for not recognizing this when they complain repeatedly about Amare and Carmelo driving into the teeth of the defense and making horrible plays. Also, it should be clear that there continues to be difficult to nail down effects from PG play. Why is it that Rubio has such a terrible PER, but people still think he's hugely responsible for Minnesota's resurgence this year. The fact is, a PG can encourage good floor spacing and crisp passing which reduces TOs for the team as a whole. Anyone who's watched the Knicks since Lin took over can see immediately that there's a dramatic and bad difference in the offense when Lin comes out. Baron Davis may be ameliorating that soon, indications at the end of last game were good.</p>

<p>People who should know better aren't using their words <link to saber metrics forum post></p>

<p>If Steve Nash were compared to Sebastian Telfair, would you say he had a turnover problem?</p>

<p>How about the eye test? Lin just looks lackadaisical. Well, no, when Nash played the Clippers, he lost the ball in several embarrassing ways.</p>

<p>How about the "can't go left". First of all, he CAN go left. This is one of the silliest conceits in basketball analysis. He can go left enough to keep them honest, which is the standard used in many other sports analogies. Notice how he smoked Kyrie Irving at the end of the Cleveland game.</p>

<p>Why the focus on Lin's TOs? Some honest innumeracy, some sensationalism, some hate, some anti-hype, some feigning </p>

<p>Trying to make Lin a stat chaser. We complain about people chasing stats but then encourage it with stupid anlaysis</p>
